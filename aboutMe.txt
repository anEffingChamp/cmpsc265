In this very first homework, you are expected tocreate a .txt file that contains
the following information about yourself.

•The full spelling of your name, and how would you like to be addressed?

    Jonathan Smalls, you can call me Jon.

•What is your major and current grade?

    major: computer science
    grade: junior

•Have you had any programming experience before? If so, please describe your
experience briefly.

    I work full time as a web developer for a government agency. I attend
    classes part time to improve my skills as a engineer.

•In your previous programming experience if you have any,
what is the most challenging and difficult part in your opinion?  What makes you
feel enjoyable?

    Edge cases are the most challenging part of programming for me. Getting a
    function to work under certain conditions is one thing, but accounting for
    edge cases can be challenging.
        I most enjoy the fact that programming is literally taking an
    unopinionated machine, and teaching it to make life easier for a living,
    breathing human being. I think that that part is fantastic.

•What is you career goal?

    I want to make a lot of money without a lot of stress.

•Tell me a little bit more about yourself.

    My minor is theater. I like to make art with my friends when I am not
    developing. I also enjoy carpentry and environmental science quite a lot.

•If you have a job, how many hours a week do you need to work.

    I work 40 hours weekly.

•How many courses are you taking this semester, and how many of them are math/engineering related course.

    I am enrolled in two classes. This is the only engineering course. The other
    is an acting class related to my minor.
