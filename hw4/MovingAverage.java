 * Write a class that can implement the following: Given a stream of integers

 * 10) / 2m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3Outputs:Your

 * number to specify the size of the window: 3Please enter a number to be added
 * into the window: 1The average after adding the above number is: 1.0Please
 * enter a number to be added into the window: 10The average after adding the
